•	Built a regression-based ML model to predict expected salary packages using 20+ candidate parameters (JEE rank, academic scores, skills, project experience). 
•	Performed data preprocessing including feature encoding, scaling, outlier handling, and correlation analysis to improve model reliability.
•	Applied feature importance and model evaluation metrics (R², MAE, RMSE) to validate performance and interpret key influencing factors.
•	Developed a user-friendly script for input-to-output salary prediction, enabling quick decision support for students or placement cells.
